#### Objective of the Project

Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how
annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.


#### Acquire Datasets 

After reading the project details, requirements and business objective, I downloaded the monthly 2023 dataset provided in the Project using this link [Dataset](http://https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and collected all the files within one folder to keep them organized.

**Keeping a backup:** Then I unzipped all the files into a new folder and kept all the zipped files into a seperate folder named Backup to ensure that I can refer back to this folder just in case there is any data corruption or deletion or unwanted changes during the data manipulation process.

**Applications used:**
I reviewed a sample file in Excel to gain a preliminary understanding of the data structure (columns, data types, volume). Due to the large size of the datasets, I opted for BigQuery for data processing and analysis. 

**BigQuery offers these advantages:**
**Scalability:** Handles large datasets efficiently.
**Speed:** Performs complex calculations and queries quickly.
**Data Export**: Allows downloading the data in various formats.

**Tableau for Visualization**
- I find Tableau a great tool for visualization. Its ease of use, drag and drop  functions to quickly see the graphs are quick and agile. 
- It can handle large amounts of data
- Allows calculation and aggregations on the fly
- I can also create dashboard for an all in one view and share the observations and recommendations
